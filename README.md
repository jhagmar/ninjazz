# Ninjazz

Ninjazz was developed as an entertaining demonstration of the capabilities of WebAssembly, WebGL and WebXR for a presentation. The demo is available [here](https://ninjazz.aztex.eu). It is certainly not the prettiest code around, but that was not the purpose. It did its job of getting the attention of my audience :).

## Navigation

The camera can be moved with the arrow keys or WASD. Floor level adjustment can be made with the 'R' and 'F' keys. The pool can be stirred with the mouse or a VR controller by pressing the mouse button/controller trigger while pointing at the water.

## Features

The pool is a visualization of a 2D wave equation solver written in C++. The rotating Lorenz attractor above the pool was written in Rust. WebXR and hence the VR experience is, at the time of writing, only available in Chrome under Windows.
